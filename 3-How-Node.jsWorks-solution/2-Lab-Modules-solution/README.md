# key points to remember
1. Don't avoid .js extension while importing in es6 module.

2.Nodejs by default uses commonjs modules, but we can change it in two diffent ways..
    1. add "type" : "module" in package.json file.
    2.Change the extension of javascript files from .js to .mjs..

Happy Coding....
